/* ************ Notes ************* 

Datatypes

*********** Primitive DataTypes***********

1. Number => used to store number (range = stores 2 to power 53)
2. bigInt => used to store big number
3. string => " ", ''
4. boolean => true / false
5. null => dataypes as well as standalone value in JS ( it is a representation of empty value ) we can assign it to the variable as well
6. undefined => that means value is not defined
7. symbol => used for uniqueness 



use tc39 and mdm for documentation

JS avoid all the spaces 

code readability should be high

"use strict";  this is used to tell browser that treat all JS code as newer version

alert( 3 + 3 ) we can not use this syntax because we uare using nodeJs, not browser 

typeOf is used to check the datatype of variable
