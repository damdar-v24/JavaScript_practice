// Array

=> Array Declaration : In JavaScript, you can declare an array in a few different ways. Here are the most common methods:

1 => let arr = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']; 

You can use square brackets [] to create an array and define its elements directly.

2 => let numbers = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4); => You can also create an array using the Array constructor

3 => let emptyArray = new Array(5);  =>  if you pass only one argument, it creates an array with that many empty slots:

4 => let colors = Array.of('red', 'green', 'blue'); => This method creates a new array with a variable number of elements passed as arguments.

5 => let str = 'hello';
let letters = Array.from(str);  => ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
=> Array.from() : This method creates a new array from an array-like or iterable object (like strings or sets)




/*************** Array Methods ***************/

1. push() => Adds one or more elements to the end of an array

2. pop() => Removes the last element from an array.

4. unshift() => Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array.

5. shift() => Removes the first element from an array.

6. includes() => Checks if an array contains a specified element.

7. indexOf() => Returns the first index at which a given element appears in an array. If the element is not found, it returns -1.

8. join() => method is used to combine all the elements of an array into a single string. datatype of the output will be String.

9. slice() => without modifying the original array, It returns a new array containing the sliced elements.

10. splice() => return a new array containing the values between given index including lower and upper index limit and  Modifies the original array by removing elements.

. Arrays.sort() => Sorts the elements of an array in ascending order.

. Arrays.toString() => Converts an array to a string representation

. Arrays.equals() => Compares two arrays for equality





=> Example of Shallow Copy

const originalObject = { name: "Alice", details: { age: 25 } };
const shallowCopy = { ...originalObject };

shallowCopy.details.age = 30;  => This changes the inner object, affecting both

console.log(originalObject.details.age); => 30
console.log(shallowCopy.details.age); => 30

=> In this example, both originalObject and shallowCopy share the same reference to the details object, so modifying details in one affects the other



=> The Array object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name, and has members for performing common array operations.

=> JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types.

=> JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on — and the last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1.

=> JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies. (All standard built-in copy operations with any JavaScript objects create shallow copies, rather than deep copies).

=> Shallow Copies : a shallow copy means that when you make a copy of an object, the new copy still points to the same things inside the original object. So, if you change something in the original object, it might also change in the copy because they share the same data.

=> You can use Object.assign() or the spread operator (...) to create a shallow copy of an object.

=> You can use the slice() method, Array.from(), or the spread operator (...) to create a shallow copy of an array.

2. Deep Copies =>  a deep copy means creating a completely independent copy of an object. Unlike a shallow copy, the properties in the deep copy don’t share the same data as the original object. So, if you change something in the original object, it won’t affect the copy, and vice versa. Each object has its own set of data, including any nested objects inside it.
